    Given a prompt, Flux.1-dev generates general purpose images with high quality and consistency.

        Path to generated images
    

            Note:
            - For atmosphere/mood/lighting/style improvements or enhancing visual qualities, create a generating_prompt that:
                * Integrates specific atmospheric details into the original prompt
                * Uses descriptive language for the desired mood or visual effect
                * Examples:
                    - "make it more dramatic" -> "A dramatic scene with high contrast lighting, deep shadows, and intense atmosphere, showing [original elements]"
                    - "enhance cozy feeling" -> "A warm and intimate setting with soft, golden lighting and comfortable ambiance, featuring [original elements]"
                    - "more professional atmosphere" -> "A polished and sophisticated environment with clean lines and professional lighting, showcasing [original elements]"
                    - "enhance ghostly features" -> "A haunting scene with ethereal, translucent ghostly elements that emit a subtle glow, featuring [original elements]"
                    - "make waves more dramatic" -> "A scene with powerful, dynamic waves with detailed foam and spray, showing [original elements]"
                    - "increase texture detail" -> "A scene with highly detailed surfaces, emphasizing intricate textures and fine details in [original elements]"
                    - "enhance lighting" -> "A scene with dramatic lighting effects, creating bold contrasts and atmospheric illumination for [original elements]"
             
            - For generating_prompt:
                - Converting negative statements into positive ones by rephrasing to focus on what should be included, without mentioning what should not be included. Examples:
                    * "Do not wear a coat" -> "Wear a light sweater"
                    * "No trees in background" -> "Clear blue sky background"
                    * "Remove the hat" -> "Show full hair styling"
                    * "Not smiling" -> "Serious expression"
                    * "No bright colors" -> "Muted, subtle tones"
                - For ensuring main subjects appear in the image, structure the prompt to:
                    Start with the primary focal element and its key attributes, then build outward with supporting elements, describing their spatial relationships and interactions. Connect elements with clear positional language and natural transitions. For example, instead of:
                    (x) "A vintage armchair. A sleeping cat. A Persian rug. Antique books. Wooden shelves."
                    Write:
                    (v) "A vintage leather armchair dominates the corner, its worn texture catching the ambient light. A cat sleeps peacefully on the Persian rug spread before it, while antique books line the wooden shelves along the wall."

            Available models:
            1. Flux.1-dev: 
    Given a prompt, Flux.1-dev generates general purpose images with high quality and consistency.

        prompt: The text prompt describing the image to generate
        
    Returns:
        Path to generated images
    
            2. PowerPaint:

    Args:
        prompt: The text prompt describing the desired modifications or object to remove
        existing_image_dir: The path to the existing image to edit
        mask_image_dir: Path to mask image defining regions to edit
        task: The inpainting task type, either "text-guided" or "object-removal"
        seed: Random seed for reproducibility
        guidance_scale: The guidance scale for the PowerPaint model (higher values increase prompt adherence)

    Returns:
        Path to generated image
    

            Note:
            - Best cases for selecting Flux.1-dev:
                - If the prompt is general, the Flux.1-dev model should be selected.

                - For atmosphere/mood/lighting/style improvements or enhancing visual qualities, select Flux.1-dev and create a generating_prompt that:
                * Integrates specific atmospheric details into the original prompt
                * Uses descriptive language for the desired mood or visual effect
                * Examples:
                    - "make it more dramatic" -> "A dramatic scene with high contrast lighting, deep shadows, and intense atmosphere, showing [original elements]"
                    - "enhance cozy feeling" -> "A warm and intimate setting with soft, golden lighting and comfortable ambiance, featuring [original elements]"
                    - "more professional atmosphere" -> "A polished and sophisticated environment with clean lines and professional lighting, showcasing [original elements]"
                    - "enhance ghostly features" -> "A haunting scene with ethereal, translucent ghostly elements that emit a subtle glow, featuring [original elements]"
                    - "make waves more dramatic" -> "A scene with powerful, dynamic waves with detailed foam and spray, showing [original elements]"
                    - "increase texture detail" -> "A scene with highly detailed surfaces, emphasizing intricate textures and fine details in [original elements]"
                    - "enhance lighting" -> "A scene with dramatic lighting effects, creating bold contrasts and atmospheric illumination for [original elements]"
                
                - For rearrangement improvements (e.g., repositioning elements), select Flux.1-dev and create a generating_prompt that combines the original prompt with the improvement suggestions to ensure proper placement
                    
            - Best cases for selecting PowerPaint:
                - For high-quality inpainting and object removal, select PowerPaint. Best use cases include:
                    * Precise object removal with natural background filling (e.g., "remove the person from the image", "erase the car")
                    * Adding completely new objects to specific regions (e.g., "add a realistic cat to the sofa", "place a vase of flowers on the table")
                    * When adding an object, provide the exact bounding box coordinates of the referring object to be added in the format of "[x1,y1,x2,y2]" while the coordinates for the referred removing object can be None (The given image resolution is 1024x1024)
                    * Seamless texture replacement (e.g., "replace the brick wall with wood paneling", "change the grass to sand")
                    * Complex scene modifications that require natural blending (e.g., "add a window to the wall", "place a door in the hallway")
                    
            - For generating_prompt:
                - Converting negative statements into positive ones by rephrasing to focus on what should be included, without mentioning what should not be included. Examples:
                    * "Do not wear a coat" -> "Wear a light sweater"
                    * "No trees in background" -> "Clear blue sky background"
                    * "Remove the hat" -> "Show full hair styling"
                    * "Not smiling" -> "Serious expression"
                    * "No bright colors" -> "Muted, subtle tones"
                - For ensuring main subjects appear in the image, structure the prompt to:
                    Start with the primary focal element and its key attributes, then build outward with supporting elements, describing their spatial relationships and interactions. Connect elements with clear positional language and natural transitions. For example, instead of:
                    (x) "A vintage armchair. A sleeping cat. A Persian rug. Antique books. Wooden shelves."
                    Write:
                    (v) "A vintage leather armchair dominates the corner, its worn texture catching the ambient light. A cat sleeps peacefully on the Persian rug spread before it, while antique books line the wooden shelves along the wall."

            - The item "task_type" in returned JSON should be "text-guided" or "object-removal" for PowerPaint.
                * When the task is about adding or replacing an object, the "task_type" should be "text-guided". Its full name is "text-guided inpainting".
                * When the task is about removing an object, the "task_type" should be "object-removal".

            - The item "bbox_coordinates" in returned JSON should be the bounding box coordinates of the object to be added in the format of "[x1,y1,x2,y2]" while the coordinates for the referred removing object can be None (The given image resolution is 1024x1024)
